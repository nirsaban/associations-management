Single source of truth for who can do what.
If a new capability is added to the product, its row is added here **before** implementation.

## Role reminder

| Code | Hebrew | Scope | Key rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | סופר אדמין | Platform (across all organizations) | Never acts as ADMIN of any organization |
| `ADMIN` | אדמין | One organization | Zero visibility into any other organization |
| `GROUP_MANAGER` | מנהל קבוצה | One group | Works only within own group |
| `GROUP_MEMBER` | חבר קבוצה | One group | May be assigned the Weekly Distributor state |
| `REGULAR_USER` | משתמש רגיל | One organization, no group | Self-service only |

Weekly Distributor is a **state** of a Group Member, not a role. Rotates weekly.

A single user can simultaneously be `REGULAR_USER` + `GROUP_MEMBER` + `GROUP_MANAGER` + the current week's `WEEKLY_DISTRIBUTOR`. UI shows the most relevant context; backend evaluates every action against all applicable scopes.

Notes:
1. Group members may see basic group context (name, members list) — no operational data.
2. SUPER_ADMIN sees payment data at platform scope, not at group scope — they don't operate at group scope by design.

Notes:

## Data isolation rules (non-negotiable)

1. Every tenant-scoped query is filtered by `organizationId` via the Prisma extension. SUPER_ADMIN requests bypass the filter.
2. `ADMIN` of organization A cannot read, list, create, update, or delete anything belonging to organization B — attempts return 403 or empty results.
3. `GROUP_MANAGER` of group G cannot operate on any group other than G, even within the same organization.
4. Weekly Distributor sees only delivery-relevant data for the current week's assignment.
5. No role except `SUPER_ADMIN` can ever cross organization boundaries.

## How to add a new capability

1. Add the row to the correct table above with ✅ / ❌ / 🟡 for every role.
2. If it crosses scopes (e.g. admin-level but also exposed to group manager), add a clarifying note.
3. Only then implement the endpoint / UI. Controller guards must match this table exactly.
